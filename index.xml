      <description>Use with Visual Studio 2017 If you have SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio 2017 (SSDT 2017) installed:
  Download the extension from Extensions and Updates under the Tools menu item as shown in the image below..   Restart SSDT 2017 and you should see the tool under the Tools menu item.
  A good part of this option is that you automatically get an update installed in SSDT whenever a newer version of the wizard is available in the marketplace.</description>
